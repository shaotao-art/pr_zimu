Implementation of the freedom in the university calendar
Do you think every day can mei-mei sleep from 8 PM to 11 PM the next day
dream
Enter the university you will find that such a sad fact
Actually sleeping less than five hours a day
Even happy all night long
In a dormitory
Every time I put the quilt to prepare meimei's sleep
Constant keyboard tapping from under the bed
Roommate cry even m playing games
I had to plug headphones
Immersed in their own world
Finally we all went to bed
I take off the headphones could finally thought of a good sleep
Ear rings again roommate that rhythmic symphony
You are tall I low
You low me high
You and me
In this way
I from the first person to go to bed
Into the last person to sleep
I'm totally collapsed
I was thinking how to a good sleep is so difficult in university
Whenever I thought of here
I hate the pounded his
You say you
Why sleep so early
You have no other things
You can't learn to learn
To play computer games
Then listen to the music
Why do so unwillingly
Go to bed early to suffer
So I really do
I began to play the game
Begin to learn
Start my way to eat chicken
Then you do so under the condition of only two possibilities
The first
You find your roommate is e-sports iron man
You simply cannot play them
Yourself drowsy when someone else is spirit
Wait until others over time
Maybe you already fell asleep on the desk
Sorry no
This not only can't solve the problem
But will also make you more hate myself
Why is it so weak
Learning to learn but even
Playing video games not so persistent
The second possibility is finally you contend for the gas
Win them
Defeated the e-sports iron man
Others candidly admit defeat
But you found that you write your homework or play games
Already possessed
Excitement can't sleep
This situation is even worse
You probably can't sleep all night
Since the storm can't
Then I began to turn attack to defend
I want to
Can you have a roommate sleep a little earlier
I tried to change their coffee into mud
Their computer's hard drive to pry
But all of these could not prevent their footsteps
E-sports ironman is e-sports ironman
You will never beat the ironman
It will be they suddenly and violently dozen
The left tears of regret
I also tried when they sleep
Hold their noses
But when I'm excited to see
Whenever I hold their nose when they stop snoring
I am very glad to glad to back to bed
But a sonata to bed again began to ring
I'm very collapse
Facts have proved these mortals method is invalid for them
So I want to use magic to defeat the magic
So I bought eye mask ear plugs
Ann hisa ear plugs
You're worth it
Wear earplugs
Suddenly you're deaf
The world always quiet down
Always free
The world indeed becomes clean after wearing earplugs eye mask
The world really become dark Yi Mian
But I'm still a bit under the weather
Too long to wear one plug
It is easy to cause pain
Sleep eyes wearing two salted egg superman salted egg
Is also very uncomfortable
After all, I am a man who used to sleep naked
Before long ear plugs and goggles are completely into the trash can
In fact,
The school is the true god
It was a calm
A sunny day
Suggests that I happy mood
School power notification that the dormitory after 11 o 'clock
Although my mouth was poking fun at this school is a fool
Should university also power outages
But my heart is glad
Because I know
I want to sleep safe day finally arrived
But actually the last for several reasons
The school is not the actual implementation of the rules
The following
I change my Mr Wang to warn at 1 PM in the classmates
I want to remind you
People in even play games always hear his own voice
When the play watch pioneer
In the face of heroes SAO gas go a pretty good feel quite yourself
Maybe all not class
At one's drunk
Considered electrical campaign hand addiction
Also can mak
Feel the fun
But embarking on this
Can't make so much noise in the daytime best;
Also please keep your voice down
Leave some room for manoeuvre - don't leave the dormitory "braying dormitory" reputation
-an original karaoke from Mr Wang with a donkey town
Watch the video companions
If it is a female classmate
Maybe this is not empathy
If you also happen to have a like in the middle of the night even Michael's roommate
Please tell your story
And put forward valuable Suggestions
So I can sleep well
